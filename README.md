2Ô∏è‚É£ **Processing & Storage:**
- The collected data is **stored in an SQLite database** for local analysis.
- The app **processes** the signal strength and determines the **quality of the network** in different locations.

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Visualization & Output:**
- The **Google Maps API** is used to **display the signal strength visually**.
- **Color-coded indicators** are used to represent signal strength
